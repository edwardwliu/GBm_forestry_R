# GBm_forestry_R
A gradient boosting algorithm implemented in R.

## To-do
*Milestone 1*: Correct gradient boosting algorithm in R.
1. Add cross-validation for gamma values.
2. Use forestry package instead of rpart.
3. Add hyperparameters.

*Milestone 2*: Implement algorithm in C (with speed, performance, etc.)
*Milestone 3*: R package compatibility.
